![alt text](misc/boat.jpg?raw=true)

Capstone engineering project by Michael Stinson, Ikponmwosa Evbayiro, Daniel Lamonte, Chimaobi Omeh, and Fredy Orellana.

The purpose of this project is to enhance water pollution monitoring through real-time analysis. It aims to enable remote testing in shallow bodies of water using an autonomous device capable of navigating through a route determined by the user to conduct water quality measurements and determine meaningful trends and patterns from the data.
